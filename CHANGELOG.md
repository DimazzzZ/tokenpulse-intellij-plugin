# Changelog

All notable changes to the TokenPulse plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Redesigned status-bar tooltip** — hovering the status-bar widget now opens an all-new,
  natively rendered popup that shows your usage at a glance:
  - real progress bars for every provider and account (replacing the old HTML tooltip),
  - theme-aware colors that shift green → orange → red as a quota fills,
  - humanized reset times (`Today 14:30`, `Tomorrow 09:00`, `Wed 09:00`, `Aug 3, 14:30`),
  - accounts grouped under their provider with one clear section each,
  - screen-clamped positioning so it always fits on screen.
- **Nebius session auto-refresh** — silently re-mints the CSRF token when it rotates (the most
  common auth failure) by re-fetching the SPA landing page and scraping the fresh `csrfToken`,
  so a still-valid session keeps working without reconnecting.
- **Xiaomi session auto-refresh** — silently re-mints the Xiaomi platform session when it goes
  stale by replaying the captured cookies, so a still-valid login keeps working without
  reconnecting.
- **Xiaomi in-IDE sign-in** — the "Connect Xiaomi Account" dialog can capture the session from an
  embedded browser login (harvesting the platform cookies directly), in addition to the manual
  cURL capture flow.
- **Claude Code multi-account support** — discovers and tracks every Claude account on disk
  (default `~/.claude` plus any `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` locations, including suffixed macOS Keychain
  entries), adding one row per account with its own config dir.
- **Per-account identity labels** — Claude account display names are enriched from the account's
  `oauthAccount` (email • organization) on first successful refresh.

### Changed
- **Unified Xiaomi MiMo provider** — the two previous connection types ("API (pay-as-you-go)"
  and "Token Plan") are merged into a single **Xiaomi MiMo** account that tracks both the
  pay-as-you-go dollar balance and the Token Plan Credits usage from the same captured
  platform session. The status bar shows the dollar balance when present and falls back to
  Token Plan usage otherwise; the tooltip shows both. Existing accounts are migrated on load
  (both legacy types remap to the unified provider); duplicate accounts for the same Xiaomi
  login are merged on first refresh.
- **Progress-bar rendering** — as part of the tooltip redesign, the status-bar tooltip is now
  assembled as a Swing panel (`TokenPulseTooltipPanel` + `TooltipModel`) instead of generated
  HTML, and `ProgressBarRenderer` is now a theme-aware color helper (returns `JBColor`s rather
  than HTML strings).
- **Claude account labels** — auto-named personal organizations (`"<email>'s Organization"`) are
  collapsed so the label shows just the email; real organization names still display as
  `email • Organization`. Existing persisted names are migrated on load.
- **Refresh-failure notifications are auth-type aware** — API-key providers (Cline, OpenAI API key,
  Xiaomi, OpenRouter provisioning) get a "re-enter your API key" hint on an auth error, while
  CLI/OAuth/session providers (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenAI OAuth, Nebius session, OpenRouter
  bridge) show only the provider's own (already actionable) message.
- **Claude Code usage now uses the OAuth API exclusively** — reads the credentials `claude` already stored
  (macOS Keychain / `~/.claude/.credentials.json`) and calls the usage endpoint directly, with
  automatic token refresh on expiry (the rotated tokens are written back to the credential store,
  keychain or file, so the real `claude` login stays in sync), instead of scraping `claude` CLI output.
  The legacy CLI-output parser (`ClaudeCliOutputParser` / `ClaudeCliUsageExtractor`) has been removed.
- **Codex/ChatGPT usage now uses the OAuth API directly** — reads the credentials `codex` already
  stored in `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) and calls ChatGPT's usage endpoint
  directly for the 5-hour, weekly, and code-review quotas, instead of spawning a `codex app-server`
  JSON-RPC subprocess. Expired access tokens are refreshed and the rotated tokens are written back
  to `auth.json` so the real `codex` login stays in sync. Also fixes a display bug where reset
  timestamps were mis-scaled (treated as milliseconds instead of seconds). The app-server client
  (`CodexAppServerClient`) and its CLI-output parser (`CodexCliOutputParser`) have been removed.
- **Accounts table** — the "API Key" column shows the Claude config dir (`~/.claude`,
  `~/.claude-work`) for Claude Code rows instead of a key preview.
- **Claude helper renamed and split** — `ClaudeCliExecutor` is now `ClaudeCliDetector`
  (its public surface is just `isInstalled()` + `verifyVersion()`), and OS detection moved to
  a provider-agnostic `HostOs` enum + `detectHostOs()` in `utils`.

### Fixed
- **Logged-in Claude users no longer shown as "session expired"** — a missing or unparseable token
  expiry is treated as usable (with a small clock-skew buffer); only a genuine `invalid_grant`
  refresh failure is treated as an auth error, and a usage `403` is reported as an
  access/permission problem instead of a login prompt (now also sends `anthropic-version`).

### Removed
- **`ClaudeConnectDialog`** — replaced by inline account discovery in the Add-Account dialog.
- **Legacy Claude CLI usage-extraction** — `ClaudeCliOutputParser`, `ClaudeCliUsageExtractor`,
  and their tests (`ClaudeCliOutputParserTest`, `ClaudeCliFunctionalTest`); pruned the unused
  `getEnvironment()` and `getWorkingDirectory()` helpers on the CLI helper.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **ClinePass usage limits** for Cline API key accounts — optional 5-hour, weekly, and monthly
  usage (percent + reset time) displayed in the tooltip when available
- **TokenPulsePluginService** — centralized version retrieval and update-notification plumbing

### Changed
- **Claude CLI detection reliability** — version check now uses a bounded timeout (8 s) instead of
  unbounded `waitFor`, preventing UI hangs when the Claude binary doesn't respond
- **CLI connect dialog hardening** — `performDetection()` is wrapped in a `try/catch` so any
  exception resolves the UI state instead of freezing on "Detecting…"
- **Modal dialog UI fix** — `invokeLater` now uses `ModalityState.any()` so detection results
  update the dialog's status label immediately while the modal is still open
- **Invalid HTML sanitized** — `Row.comment()` calls no longer pass `html`-wrapped strings,
  eliminating the `UiDslException` from `idea.log`
- **Debug logging added** — info-level `TokenPulseLogger.UI` entries in `detectCli()` and
  `performDetection()` for easier troubleshooting

### Fixed
- **CliConnectDialog NPE** (PR #16) — constructor-time access to subclass properties before
  initialization completed, causing `NullPointerException` in `RowImpl.label(text)`
- **Xiaomi token-plan `JsonNull` handling** (PR #14) — `ClassCastException` when the API returns
  `null` for `data`, `monthUsage`, or `items` fields
- **Tooltip loading state** — status-bar tooltip now shows "Refreshing balances…" during initial
  refresh (e.g. Claude cold start) instead of the misleading "No accounts configured"

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Xiaomi MiMo provider** — Two connection types: API (pay-as-you-go) and Token Plan (subscription Credits)
- **Session capture flow** — XiaomiConnectDialog for capturing platform session via cURL
- **Shared infrastructure** — SessionParser, HttpErrorHandler, CurlCookieExtractor utilities for session-based providers
- **Status bar format options** — Percentage, Used/Remaining, Remaining only with Compact/Descriptive variants
- **Short number formatting** — Credits displayed as 3.3B, 7.7M, 1.5K for readability

### Changed
- **Account fields changed to `var`** — Required for XStream XML serialization (was breaking account persistence on restart)
- **Status bar format improvements** — formatAutoMode now iterates all accounts until finding usable data
- **Widget refresh on settings change** — Status bar updates immediately when format dropdown changes
- **Code quality overhaul** — Extracted utilities, improved test coverage, fixed detekt issues

### Fixed
- **Account serialization** — All Account fields must be `var` for XStream deserialization
- **Status bar showing "--"** — Fixed multiple issues causing status bar to show no data
- **Format order** — "Used / Remaining" now shows "Remaining / Total" as intended
- **PERCENTAGE_REMAINING** — Returns "--" instead of raw dollar amount when percentage cannot be calculated
- **Xiaomi API accountId** — Fixed empty accountId in BalanceSnapshot

### Removed
- **Unused constants** — Removed XIAOMI_API_URL, XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_SGP_URL, duplicate formatCredits
